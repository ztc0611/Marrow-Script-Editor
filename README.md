# Marrow Script Editor
An open source program written to allow easy editing of dialouge hash maps, friendly to non-programmers. It is based on the dialouge system of Animal Crossing, primarily Wild World. It was created in Godot 4 so it should run on all major operating systems.

## How do I use this?
You will have to write your own implimentation of the text display. However, this should be possible to use cross-engine. It can also be modified to work for different types of dialouge systems or to have new line display types.
